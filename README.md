# Infosys Springboard Internship Project

This project is part of my **Infosys Springboard Internship**.  
The goal of the project is to analyze a **large dataset of road accidents** to uncover trends, patterns, and key factors contributing to accident severity.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python.
- Extract meaningful insights to help improve **road safety**.
- Communicate findings through **visualizations, documentation, and presentation**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas** → data cleaning & manipulation
- **Matplotlib** → visualizations
- **Seaborn** → advanced statistical plots
- (Optional) **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation

---

## 📊 Outcomes
- Learn how to handle and preprocess **real-world accident data**.  
- Explore accident frequency based on **time, location, weather, and road conditions**.  
- Visualize accident severity using multiple types of plots and graphs.  
- Derive insights that can support **road safety awareness and policy recommendations**.  
- Document and present findings in a structured way.  

---

## 📂 Dataset
**US Accidents Dataset** (from Kaggle):  
👉 [US Accidents (4.2 million records)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)

This dataset includes:
- **Time & Date** of accidents  
- **Location** (city, state, latitude/longitude)  
- **Severity** levels  
- **Weather conditions** (temperature, visibility, precipitation, etc.)  
- **Road conditions**
